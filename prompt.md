That is a good start. Now, can you reduce the height of the menu a bit, maybe by half. Can you also make sure that some margin is added to the right of the rightest menu items. 

Also, I would like you to remove the background color from the first text block. 

Also, under the customer testimonys, could you add a button that when you click it, and email subscribe form shows up. It should not be visible from the beginning, only when the customer presses "Subscribe now" (text of the button). The subscription buttons should not be in the testimonial buttons, but rather under them, in a new section.

The top menu is now a bit broken. Please go back to the first rendition with the logo to the left, app name in the middle and four menu items to the right. Make sure it is max 50px high. Please render the full html file with all the info you have until now, plus these changes.
